Combined Log Format is a standardized format for web server log files that includes a detailed set of information about each HTTP request made to a web server. It is a variation of the Common Log Format (CLF) that includes additional fields for user agent, referrer, and the HTTP status code.
The Combined Log Format is often used by web administrators and developers to analyze web traffic and troubleshoot issues with web servers. The format provides a standardized way to collect and analyze information about visitors to a website, including the pages they visit, the resources they access, and the errors they encounter.

Here's an example of a Combined Log Format entry:
127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 "http://www.example.com/start.html" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)"


In this example, the fields are separated by spaces, and include:

1. The IP address of the client making the request (127.0.0.1).
2. 'Username of user accessing document' refers to the username of the authenticated user who accessed the document or web page.
However, for public web sites that do not require authentication or user access controls, this field will be represented by a hyphen ("-") to indicate that there is no username associated with the request.
3. The remote user if the request was authenticated (frank).
4. The date and time of the request (10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700).
5.The request line from the client ("GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0").
6.The HTTP status code returned to the client (200).
7.The size of the response sent to the client (2326).
8.The referrer URL ("http://www.example.com/start.html").
9.The user agent string ("Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)").



8. The "referrer URL" in the Combined Log Format refers to the URL of the web page that linked to the current page. In other words, it's the page that the user was on before they clicked a link or entered the URL that led them to the current page.
The referrer URL is included in the log entry to help website administrators and developers track the sources of traffic to their website. By analyzing the referrer information in web server logs, they can gain insights into how users are finding their website and which pages are most popular.
For example, if a website owner sees that a particular referrer URL is sending a lot of traffic to their site, they may want to focus on optimizing their content and links for that particular source to attract even more traffic. Or, if they see that a certain page is frequently being linked to from external sites, they may want to improve that page's content or design to make it more engaging or useful to visitors.
In the Combined Log Format, the referrer URL is indicated by the field enclosed in double quotes immediately preceding the user agent string. For example, in the log entry from my previous answer, the referrer URL is "http://www.example.com/start.html".

9. The "user agent string" in the Combined Log Format refers to a text string that identifies the client software that made the HTTP request to the server. This string is sent in the request headers by the client's web browser or other software, and is used by the server to determine how to format the response and which content to serve.
The user agent string typically includes information about the browser name and version, the operating system, and other details about the client's software and device. Web developers can use this information to optimize their website's design and functionality for different devices and software platforms.
For example, a website may use the user agent string to detect whether a user is accessing the site from a mobile device or a desktop computer, and adjust the layout and features of the site accordingly. Alternatively, a site may use the user agent string to detect whether a user is using a particular browser version that is known to have compatibility issues, and provide alternative content or instructions.
In the Combined Log Format, the user agent string is indicated by the field enclosed in double quotes immediately following the HTTP status code. For example, in the log entry from my previous answer, the user agent string is "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)".


5. The "request line" in the HTTP protocol refers to the first line of the client's request message, which is sent to the server to request a specific resource, such as a web page or file.
The request line typically includes three pieces of information separated by spaces: the HTTP method, the resource or URL being requested, and the HTTP version being used. For example, a typical request line might look like this:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
In this example, "GET" is the HTTP method being used to request the resource, "/index.html" is the URL or path to the resource being requested, and "HTTP/1.1" is the version of the HTTP protocol being used.
Other common HTTP methods include POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD, each of which is used for different types of requests. The resource or URL being requested can include additional parameters or query strings, which are used to provide additional information or context for the request.
The request line is just one part of the HTTP request message, which also includes headers and, in some cases, a message body containing data or additional parameters. When the server receives the request message, it uses the information in the request line and headers to determine how to handle the request and generate a response.
